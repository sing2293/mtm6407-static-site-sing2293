      I design and build digital experiences that are clean, purposeful, and marketing-driven. My work sits at the intersection of design, development, and strategy creating interfaces that look sharp, feel smooth, and convert effectively. I focus on clarity, usability, and the small details that make a product feel intentional and trustworthy.

        <h3>What I like working on</h3>
        <p>
          I love working on projects that blend creativity and technical execution:
          landing pages, websites, brand visuals, motion graphics, and small interactive prototypes.
          Every component, animation, and layout I create is built with one goal—helping users navigate easily and helping brands communicate with impact.
